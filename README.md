# Semantic-Textual-Similarity
Abstract
Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the meaning similarity of sentences. Applications of this task include machine translation, summarization, text generation, question answering, short answer grading, semantic search, dialogue and conversational systems. We developed Support Vector Regression model with various features including the similarity scores calculated using alignment-based methods and semantic composition based methods. We have also trained sentence semantic representations with BiLSTM and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The correlations between our system output the human ratings were above 0.8 in the test dataset.
